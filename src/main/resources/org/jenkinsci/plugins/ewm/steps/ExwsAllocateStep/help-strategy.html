        Provide Disk allocation strategy as step parameter.
        This will override the strategy defined in the Jenkins global config.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> Some Disk allocation strategies may require additional information to be provided.
        For example, if you choose the fastest read/write speed strategy, then you must provide, for each disk,
        its read/write speed. These values should be set in the <i>Disk Information</i> section, for each <i>Disk</i>
        entry from the Jenkins global config.
