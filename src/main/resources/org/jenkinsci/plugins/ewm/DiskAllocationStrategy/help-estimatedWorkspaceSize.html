<div>
    <p>
        Optional parameter.
        It indicates the estimated size that the workspace may have.
        It has to be in MB.
    </p>
    <p>
        If provided, the Disk allocation strategy ensures that the selected disk has at least as much usable space
        left as the estimated workspace size.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, let's suppose we want to select the disk with the highest read speed, but that has a minimum
        usable space of 100 MB. The Pipeline code for that is:
    </p>
    <pre>
    def extWorkspace = exwsAllocate diskPoolId: 'diskpool1', strategy: fastestReadSpeed(estimatedWorkspaceSize: 100)
    // ...
    </pre>
</div>
