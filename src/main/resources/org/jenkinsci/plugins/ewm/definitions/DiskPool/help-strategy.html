        Select the default Disk allocation strategy to be used when allocating disks within this Disk Pool.
    </p>
    <p>
        The allocation strategy may also be provided in the Pipeline code, thus will override the one defined in the
        global config.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> Some Disk allocation strategies may require additional information to be provided.
        For example, if you choose the fastest read/write speed strategy, then you must provide, for each disk,
        its read/write speed. These values should be set in the <i>Disk Information</i> section, for each <i>Disk</i>
        entry from the Jenkins global config.
